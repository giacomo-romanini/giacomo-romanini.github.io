International lending flows are often intermediated through banking hubs and
complex multi-national routing. We develop a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
model where global banks choose the path of direct or indirect lending
through partner institutions in multiple countries. We show how conflating locational
loan flows with ultimate lending biases results both by attributing ultimate
lending to banking hubs, and by missing ultimate lending that occurs indirectly
via third countries. We next study the effects of global banking complexity.
Indirect lending allows countries to bypass shocked lending routes via alternative
countries; however, it dilutes their ability to diversify sources of funds after
shocks. The quantitative analysis reveals that banking complexity can exacerbate
credit and output instability when countries feature heterogeneous banking
efficiency.

How does the expansion of multinational banks influence the business cycle of host countries? We study an economy where multinational banks can transfer liquidity across borders through internal capital markets but are hindered in their allocation of liquidity by limited knowledge of local firmsâ€™ assets. We find that, following domestic banking shocks, multinational banks moderate the depth of the contraction but slow down the recovery. A calibration to Polish data suggests that multinational banks reduce the average depth of recessions by about 5% but increase their duration by 10%. The predictions are broadly consistent with evidence from a large panel of countries.
